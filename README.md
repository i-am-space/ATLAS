# ATLAS
A graphical analysis of the game Atlas
List of all countries with names and ISO 3166-1 codes in all languages and all data formats
For the sake of accuracy and faithfullness to the original Atlas game, I'll be bending the rules of "officially recognized" a little bit to include approximately 55 other countries that would otherwise not be here. After all, these are perfectly valid places to name in a real game of Atlas.
